Which urban fantasy books {{do you like| }}?
<<changeSpeaker DialogueRunner RF>>
Oh. Um. Well I’m not a huge fan of the new releases, I like books like {{The Dawn of the Crooked| }} but those aren’t particularly well received.

Well, um. It’s.. it’s interesting because it kind of does something that the newer releases seem kind of scared to do-
-and the fact that they put this character, Adelaide, in might seem kind of cliche, but then you look at the release dates and this is actually-
-the first time someone did something like that in an urban fantasy book. The writing is great. They don’t bore you with flowery words and-
-long descriptions of meaningless things, they just get right to the point. I really hate how newer books do that, and-
-you can never really go back after you’ve read something like this… 
It’s... 
<<changeFace Character RF_Confused>>
Ah{{...| }} 
<<changeSpeaker DialogueRunner MC>>
Well that sounds… {{interesting| }} (holding the book)
<<changeSpeaker DialogueRunner RF>>
Haha...(awkward laugh) It’s a good book, but The Maiden of the Silver Sea is far more popular right now, it’s a thrilling tale about a young woman who finds herself through travelling the sea and meeting a charming, handsome prince.

<<changeSpeaker DialogueRunner MC>>
Oh... uh, I think I’ll take {{this one| }} (holding the book RF originally recommended)
<<changeSpeaker DialogueRunner RF>>
Oh... ok, I can {{ring you up| }} right over here.
<<changeFace Character RF_Confused>>
<<wait 3>>
<<changeFace Character RF_Smile>>
Thank you for your {{purchase| }}, please come again.
<<changeSpeaker DialogueRunner MC>>
Yeah, this book seems interesting. I’ll tell you {{what I think| }} about it.
<<changeSpeaker DialogueRunner RF>>
<<changeFace Character RF_Confused>>
(while MC is heading out the door) oh.. Uh…
