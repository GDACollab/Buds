Scripts
|______ Effect Scripts

Code for visual effects, either on individual elements (particles, lighting,
etc.) or full-screen effects (blur, VHS filter, etc.). Additionally, shaders
hand-written in code.

Many effects are already available in Unity, and are configured using the
inspector (Unity's ParticleSystem, PostProcessing, etc).
